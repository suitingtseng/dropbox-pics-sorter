dropbox-pics-sorter
===================

[Hazal](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) can sort files based on rules. It works well with Dropbox folders if you have local Dropbox installed. However I have a lot of photos and I always would like to sort my photos under `/Camera Uploads` into folders with data like `/Camera Uploads/2017/06/15` without downloading them. This tool does that for you.

### Build from source

```
  make
```

### Or install with `go get`

```
  go get github.com/suitingtseng/dropbox-pics-sorter
```

### Usage

```
  dropbox-pics-sorter -token <your-dropbox-api-token>
```

Profit!
